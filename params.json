{"name":"Bash-deploy-wp-roots","tagline":"Deploy a fresh local copy of WordPress with the Roots starter theme","body":"Auto Deploy WordPress & Roots\r\n====================\r\n\r\nFor a local Ubuntu 14.04 deverlopment enviropnment. Requires [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/).\r\n\r\nNote: I'm pretty new to BASH scripting so please read through this code carefully. It works well for us, but use at your own risk!\r\n\r\n##What it Does##\r\n\r\n* Creates a new directory for a [WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress) site in ```/var/www```.\r\n* Creates a new WordPress test site, with a fresh database.\r\n* Downloads, renames and activates the [Roots](https://github.com/roots/roots) theme.\r\n* Sets up a new GitHub repo for the new theme (A GitHub personal token and SSH keys need to be in place)\r\n* Downloads & activates the [Soil](https://github.com/roots/soil) plugin.\r\n* Installs node & bower dependencies by running npm install.\r\n\r\nThis script automatically deploys a fresh local copy of WordPress with the Roots starter theme. Builds a new database, clones the Roots starter theme, copies Roots and sets up a newly renamed theme, installs node dependencies and sets up a fresh GitHub repo for your project.\r\n\r\n##Security Notes##\r\nBecause the script is designed to quickly create a local development site, the database credentials aren't particularly secure - the db name is used as a \"salt\" for username & password. You shouldn't use the unedited script to generate a WordPress installation on a public-facing server. It would be easy to amend this so that the user is prompted to enter secure database credentials.\r\n\r\nBecause you might copy the local database to a public server, you should enter a secure username & password for WordPress when prompted.\r\n\r\n##How to Use##\r\n\r\n* Clone this script and save the ```roots-spin``` file as ```/usr/local/bin/roots-spin```.\r\n* Make it executable: ```sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/roots-spin```.\r\n* Run the script by entering \"roots-spin\" in the terminal.\r\n\r\nNOTE: depending on your node setup, you may need to amend the ```setup_node ()``` function in this script.\r\nSee inline comments for more info.\r\n\r\nPull requests welcome!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
